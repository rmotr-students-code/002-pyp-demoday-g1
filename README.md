## Purpose
Steam sales are a daily occurrence but there are way too many games to keep track of. Use SteamScout to alert you
when a game that you're interested in drops down to the price you set.

## How To Use SteamScout
1. Sign up to make an account
2. Use the link sent to your email to validate your account
3. Search for games
4. Set a scout to email you when a game drops down to a price you set
5. SteamScout will email you automatically if any of your games hit your preferences.

- You can update/delete your set price scouts at any time.

Below will be transferred over to GH issues.

+ Paginate games library, currently causes significant lag. SQL alchemy has something built in for pagination
+ Make it mobile friendly, add media queries
+ Improve Settings page. - Improved it to look better.
+ Add percentage threshold option for preferences
+ Color divs in preferences so that users can see how close their set price is to the current price.
+ Implement Flask blueprints
+ validate each integer in the amount threshold form
+ make the individual games look pretty - Improved it, but it could be better..
+ Change generic variables to be more specific. Ex. form should should be login_form

+ Add a default currency on games page
+ Add button/link to the settings page which link to game search ''Add New Scout''

+ User must be authenticated before saving games.
